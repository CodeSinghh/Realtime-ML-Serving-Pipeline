# Realtime-ML-Serving-Pipeline
Built a backend service to help companies manage multiple ML models. New models are added daily while old ones remain, increasing latency, storage use, RAM load, and output errors. My project addresses this through smart versioning, efficient model loading, health &amp; staging environment checks, and CI/CD pipelines with API response validation.
